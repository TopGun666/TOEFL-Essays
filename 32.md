As society is developing by leaps and bounds, tremendous changes have taken place in people's life. Nevertheless, some senior citizens complain that healthy environment and harmonious interpersonal relationships are gone. As far as I'm concerned, despite some problems that come along with social progress, I still believe today's life to be easier and more comfortable than it was when our grandparents were children. I am going to elaborate my viewpoint from three aspects as follows.

To begin with, modern communication technology has reshaped our lives and brought us much convenience. To be more specific, with the wide application of smart phones and Internet, it is possible for people to contact each other more conveniently and efficiently. For example, Lily, one of my best friends, is lucky to be admitted to a famous university in America, which means we cannot hang out together like before. But thanks to the modern communication technology, we still keep in frequent touch with each other one Skype anytime, anywhere. Therefore, it feels like we have never been apart.

Besides, a variety of means of transportation makes it efficiently. For example, Lily, one of my best friends, is lucky to be admitted to a famous university in America, which means we cannot hang out together like before. But thanks to the modern communication technology, we still keep in frequent touch with each other on Skype anytime, anywhere. Therefore, it feels like we have never been apart.

Besides, a variety of means of transportation makes it efficient and comfortable for people to move around. Subways, taxis, private cars, and airplanes shorten the distance between places. My grandparents who live in suburbs, are good examples in point. When they felt like going t the urban canter, it usually took them more than one hour in the past, because of the bumpy roads and low-efficient vehicles. But nowadays, with great improvement of road condition and advanced means of transportation, they only have to spend at most 20 most 20 minutes traveling from home to city. In scorching summers, passengers can enjoy cool fresh air inside vehicles equipped with air-conditioner, which makes the trip vehicles equipped with air-conditioner, which makes the trip very comfortable.

Last but not least, today's ample food supply and various food choices are something beyond imagination in the past. Decades age, in China, all foods used to be arranged by the government. In other words, it was impossible for people to purchase what they liked to eat. For example, an average family was only alocated 1 jin of pork and 5 jin of rice every week. In contrast, nowadays, we never have to worry about the shortage of food, because we can buy all kinds of food in supermarkets and  snack bars all over the city.

To sum up, with the progress of economy and technology, we have enough reasons to believe that today's life is more comfortable and easier than it was in the past. If our government takes efficient measures to solve the environmental problem, our world will become a better place to live.
