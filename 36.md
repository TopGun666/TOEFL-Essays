Currently, in order to develop their children's independence and get them prepared for the future life, many parents encourage their children to engage in part-time jobs. However, some people claim that children's early exposure to society can be harmful for both their mental health and academic performance. In my opinion, part-time jobs can bring young people many benefits, and thus should deserve extra attention. I am going to elaborate my opinion by the reasons as follows.

To begin with, children can broaden their horizon by taking part-time jobs. If teenagers work part-time, they may confront a variety of headache situations, and in order to overcome them and finish the jobs successfully, children are required to obtain relevant knowledge and skills. As a result, their scope of knowledge can be enlarged greatly. Taking myself for example, I once took a part-time job in a cosmetics company and was assigned to hand out flyers. Though it appeared a simple task, I still learned a lot  from it , in clouding how to deal with people and how to distinguish my targets from a big crowd.

In addition, taking part-time jobs enables teenagers to make wise decisions about their future career. Only by experiencing different jobs can a teenager truly realize what suits him the best. If a teenager has no part-time job experience, how can he understand what role he wants to play in the future? My sister's experience is just a good case in point, Last summer, she got a part-time job in Starbucks. To my astonishment, she fell in love with the art of making coffee at the very beginning. Therefore, she is determined to be a barista in the future.

Admittedly, I am not saying that it is impeccable for teenagers to take part-time jobs. For instance, they may meet some ill-minded people or see the dark sides of society, which might have a negative impact impact on the minors' mentality. However, as long as parents and teachers offer them appropriate supervision and guidance, and communicate with them when problems occur, there will be nothing to worry about.

In a nutshell, to teenagers, the advantages of taking part-time jobs outweigh its disadvantages. It is because  those work experiences not only allow them to gain necessary survival skills, but also make them realize where their occupational interests lie.
