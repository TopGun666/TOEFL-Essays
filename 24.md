History course are part of university curriculum, and students are required to study them for credits. But recently, a hot topic has arisen among students about whether studying history is just a waste of time, especially for students of engineer and science. As far as I'm concerned, all students, ,in spite of their majors, are highly advised to take history courses. I am going to elaborate this viewpoint in the following paragraphs.

First of all, history courses can bring one's perspective to a higher level. Even though ancient people lived in an lived in an age very different from today, the way they acted and thought can still be applied to all aspects of modern life. And therefore, understanding what they did and how they looked at issues is of great significance to us. For example, my father is a successful business leader. Once he told me that doing business was like fighting a battle, and the way he managed his team, how he won negotiations with business partners were derived from his interest in studying classic cases of ancient wars.

Besides, history courses give students an opportunity to learn about mistakes in history. It is true that history repeat itself, but it would be tragic and disastrous if we let the same mistakes happen over and over again. Only by familiarizing ourselves with history can we draw lessons from it and acquire new inspirations that can benefit the present. The year of 2015 was the 70th anniversary of the end of wwII, and the whole world celebrated it by various activities in order to warn the world of what a war could bring to human beings. Therefore, history courses in university serve as a constant warning bell, keeping young generation vigilant.

Admittedly, it is indeed inappropriate to require students of science with poor grades to study history courses, because history courses obviously consume their time that is supposed to spent on major courses. However, with the consideration of the importance of history education, school authorities can turn required history courses into optional courses or lectures for those kind of students, which not only provide them with necessary knowledge of history but also free them from the pressure of study.

In conclusion, the history education is needed to foster well-rounded talents. Just as a Chinese proverb goes, history is like a mirror, enabling one to predict ups and downs. A good command of history helps us live well for the present and make full preparations for the future.
