This is an ever-changing world. New things keep emerging one after another with each passing day. This phenomenon also triggers a debate about whether people should update their ideas constantly or just stick to what they believe regardless of the changing times. In my opinion. daring to abandon old thoughts and embracing  new ones is a necessary quality for anyone who wants to be successful. I am going to discuss about my point of view in the following cases.

In today's commercial world, one's refusal of new ideas will knock him out of the fierce competition. With the rapid development of science and technology, every aspect of society is undergoing  profound transformation. If someone still runs a business in an old-fashioned way, he is likely to be defeated by a newcomer breaking into his field with new ideas. For example, a new way of hailing a car is gaining popularity with the rise of Apps like Uber. Traditional taxi drivers need to make some changes to their business model, instead of turning a blind eye to this new trend.

In family life, parents who are good at accepting new ideas are beneficial for their kids' growth. Some parents stubbornly live in their own world, reluctant to accept new ideas, which is actually the real cause of generation gap. By contrast, if parents are willing to embrace new ideas, they will have more common topics with their kids and understand their kids' thoughts and doings. Currently, carving out one's own business is a new fashion for college graduates. If a college graduate has such an idea, his parents should encourage him to make it happen, rather than force him to seek a stable job in a big company.

Admittedly, living in the age of information explosion, we are exposed to too many ideas every day, including good ones and bad ones. Some new ideas may be radical or contrary to universal values, and so accepting this kind of ideas blindly will be detrimental to one's spiritual world. However, as long as we stay alert and develop the ability to distinguish the good from the bad, there will be nothing to be worried about.

To put it in a nutshell, embracing new ideas and constantly, updating our own ideas can prevent us from being left behind the times. One of famous Chinese philosophers once said, "There is no holding back the wheel of history." New ideas represent new trends of world's development. Only by going with the historical trends can human being survive and thrive.
