China's economy is taking off, which brings a lot of benefits to its people including a great increase in their purchasing power. In recent years, people have become keener on buying things than ever before. Thus, a heated debate has arisen among the public about the cause of people's growing passion for shopping. The way I see it,  following suit is most likely to be the very factor that drives people to purchase. I am about to justify my viewpoint by discussing two typical cases.

The first case is the zeal for buying electronic products. As we know, the rapid development of science and technology keeps people updating their electronic products all the time. Those equipped with latest versions of high-tech gadgets are labeled as tasteful and an fashionable icons. In order to be like that, people, especially the young, tend to follow trendy individuals-to buy just exactly what they have. For example, whenever new iPhone came out in the market, there is a fever of purchasing all over the world. Of course, people do buy iPhones to facilitate communication. but they probably more want to catch up with the times.

Finance products are the other good case in point. Under most circumstances, due to the lack of a clear idea about how to buy financial products, people are inclined to follow the footsteps of others, considering that this is an effortless way to do about their wealth. In stock market, there are a multitude of amateur investors lick senior citizens, or some illiterates. They neither spend time studying the trend of the market nor investigate what's going on with the listed companies, and they do nothing but to follow some so-called professional ones to buy stocks.

Admittedly, I am not saying that people buy products without any practical purposes. It is impossible for people to buy something useless, and the practicality of what they buy is always their NO.1 concern. However, if we analyze the deep motivation of consumers when they shop, we can find that they are more likely to buy something that others have already had,  because nobody is willing to be Guinea pigs to any new product.

To put in a nutshell, people buy products not because they really need them but because others have had them. Owing to the limitation of room, I am unable to give more cases, but  believe that the above-mentioned electronic products and finance products have already proven the validity of my viewpoint.
