Whether at school or at work, doing projects is what modern people should face every day. The approaches of dealing with projects can vary from one person to another. Some prefer to handle projects one by one while others are big fans of multi-tasking. It is still debatable about which way is more effective. As for me, the ability to concentrate on one project at  a time means a lot to modern people. My reasons and examples are given below.

Firstly, it will be time-saving to finish projects one after another. It is because when focusing on what they are doing with no distracters around, people will enjoy a higher working efficiency. If people have to process different tasks simultaneously, that will be more time-consuming than doing one thing at a time. Taking myself for example, I occasionally do some translation for foreign trade companies to earn some pocket money. I don't take a new task until the last one is finished. Only in this way can I devote my mind to one job and finish it as soon as possible.

Secondly, we can guarantee the quality when dealing with one project at a time. It is obvious that people will achieve better result if all concentration and enthusiasm are placed on one single task. On the contrary, with different projects at hands, their attention is highly likely to be torn apart, and the quality of the projects will be therefore affected. My neighbor is a renowned painter in town, who attaches great importance to the quality of his works. He once told me about this little secret of success: immersing himself in one single piece of work each time.

Admittedly, I am not denying that it is advantageous to handle two or more projects simultaneously. As a matter of fact, it is multi-tasking that leads people to more productivity. However, between quality and quantity, the former seems to have priority over the latter in modern society. The high quality of projects has become the common pursuit of all companies and individuals. Thus, doing one thing at time is more beneficial to the guarantee of the quality.

To recap, it is better to finish a project and then move on to the next one. Depending on one single product-iPhone, Apple has firmly secured its NO.1 position in smart phone industry, defeating time-honored brand names like Nokia and Samsung. This is the power of concentration.
