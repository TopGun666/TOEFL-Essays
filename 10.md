As modern world becomes increasingly complicated, young people are required to be versatile to achieve success in their life or career. Thus, people are beginning to discuss about which abilities are essential for the young generation. Some people point out that the ability to plan and organize plays a fundamental role in helping young people survive this highly competitive society, and I believe this without a doubt. My reasons and examples are given below.

To begin with, the ability to plan keeps us from losing ourselves in endless tasks. As is known to all, today's young people have to deal with far greater number of tasks than people did in the past. If one lacks the ability to plan, he would drown in tons of jobs, because things keep popping out  all the time. Taking a modern college student for example, he usually has plenty of work to do, but time is always pressing. In a short period of time, he may have to handle a term paper, earn extra credits by playing the role as a teaching assistant, and search for an internship program. Under such a circumstance, a good plan can clearly help him allocate his time and energy well, which guarantees an efficient accomplishment of all the tasks.

In addition, the ability to organize enables young people to make better use of accessible resources to help them achieve goals. In modern world, one cannot achieve anything without resources such as social connections , funds or information. More importantly, these resources only work when being integrated together in a proper way. For example, my cousin, the head of a college photography club, has made his club very popular among students, which is exhibition on campus. Before that, he mobilized every member to pitch in for this activity, and settled the finding some sponsors outside the campus.

Admittedly, I am not denying the fact that there are other important abilities that young people should possess: the ability to express themselves, the ability to make new friends, or the ability to empathize with others. However, as I mentioned before, the ability to plan and organize plays a fundamental role in young people's lives or work. The two essential abilities are like the cornerstone on which other abilities are built.

From what has been discussed above, we can draw a conclusion that the development of the ability to plan and organize is of vital importance to young people at present times. It is because the ability to plan improves our efficiency of handing tasks, and the ability to organize helps us optimize the use of resources around us.
