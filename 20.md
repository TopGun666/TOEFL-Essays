Whether you believe it or not, approximately 25 percent of families world keep pets ranging from dogs and crocodiles. The number of pet owner is on the rise and so is their expenditure on pets. This phenomenon triggers a discussion about whether it is wise to spend a big sum of money on pets regardless of better ways to use the money. Although I do not keep a pet, I still believe that keep a pet is a worthwhile to do, especially for the following two cases of people.

For senior citizens,  pets can make a great company. When people are getting old, their sense of loneliness also grows with each passing day. With sons and daughters not around, old couples  naturally need something to place their emotion. In this regard, pets can serve as their family members to drive away their loneliness. For some who has lost his or her spouse, pets might become their sole emotional support. My neighbor is an old widow without any children, but she still lives a happy and enriched life because she keeps a Chihuahua that makes her life full of fun.

For kids, keeping pets is conducive to their mental development. As we all know, most kids in China grow up without siblings, and pets make up for this imperfection. In the process of keeping a pet, kid not only learn what unconditional love is, but also how to shoulder responsibility. For example, my cousin Justin is the only child in his family. Instead of being spoiled and pampered, he knows exactly how to deal with others and how to take care of someone younger. This is all he has been growing up with his best buddies-a golden retriever.

Admittedly, we also can find example of some pet owners who spend too much money on their belove pets, even beyond their means. This practice, in my eyes, is like putting the cart before the horse. After all, keeping a pet is not all of one's life. However, as lone as a pet owner keeps the expenditure in a rational level, there would be worry about.

To recap, I firmly believe keeping a pet is worth the money. In some sense, a pet is just like a special friend, to whom we can create an emotional attachment. Maybe someday in the future, I will have such a special friend around.
