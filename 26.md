For any government, there is always a lack of effective ways to encourage the public to conserve energy. One feasible method they tend to adopt is to elevate the price of energy with the hopes of forcing the citizens to reduce the waste of it. But the effectiveness of this approach has been increasingly questioned. In my opinion, raising the price of gasoline and electricity is the last resort, and couldn't solve the problem fundamentally. My reasons and examples are given below.

Firstly, raising the price could intensify the conflict between the public and the government. As an integral part of people's basic livehood, electricity and gasoline are the most widely used energy. Thus, any change in the price will affect the public's nerve. Also, it is government's responsibility to lessen people's financial burden instead of doing something against their interests. I have read a piece of news that a few years ago, the ruling party of England increased the electricity fees, hoping to alleviate the power shortage, but this conduct yielded nothing but a strong backlash.

Secondly, for the rich, increasing the price of energy doesn't make any difference. It is because government is unlikely to bring the price of energy to the point that even nobody can afford, so it will not genuinely strengthen social members' awareness of energy conservation. Plus, it is those rich people who are major consumers of energy. A good case in point is AI Gore, a former American vice president who has received a Nobel Peace Prize for his battling climate change. But a scandal shattered this image: he once squandered a great deal of energy on his daughter's birthday party.

Admittedly, I am not denying the good side of raising the price of energy. This method indeed can make people pay attention to their use of energy, because the cost is going up after all. However, although increasing the price of energy can reduce the symptom, it cannot cure the problem once and for all. Also, it probably triggers public anger, which is an expected side-effect. Government is more advised to figure out other ways to arouse the public's awareness of energy conservation without harming their interests,

In conclusion, I am opposed to the idea of encouraging energy conservation by increasing the prices of gasoline and electricity. In modern world, government should manage the whole society through some smart ways rather than simple and crude ones.
