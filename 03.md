In oriental countries, a child's achievement is traditionally believed to link to a family's glory. The idea that "spare a rod, spoil a child" runs inside a family from generation to generation. Thus, an interesting discussion has arisen: Are strict rules a necessity to help children to be successful? As far as I am concerned, strict rules could be counterproductive when being employed  by educate their children. My viewpoint is based on following reasons an examples.

Firstly, strict rules weaken children's creativity and imagination. In this fast-changing society, the ability to try something new and do away with old routines is more important than ever before. Unfortunately, many parents use strict rules to confine children's behaviors and thoughts to a cramped space. They tell their kids what should be done and what shouldn't, depriving them of the freedom to set their minds free. A good case in point is that most of the leading innovative companies were born in open an free countries such as the US, rather than in countries where strict rules are dominant ways of education.

Secondly, strict rules are disadvantageous to the cultivation of  communicative ability, which is one of the most important qualities a successful person must have. Good communicative skills help us not only secure our principles, but also gain more benefits. Nevertheless, strict rules make people obedient and afraid of fighting for their own interests. A child raised in a family full of strict rules tends to make compromises an blindly follow the footsteps of others. Taking my cousin for example, having been affected by strict rules for long, he lose the courage to argue with others, always putting himself in the inferior position of a negotiation.

Admittedly, I am not saying that strict rules are good for nothing. They do have their values in the development of kids. For instance, the personality of children nurtured by strict parents tends to be steady and modest, which allows them to lead a secure life in the future. However, if viewed from anther angle, that " vantage  point" o strict rules is actually plausible, because children's character is likely to be rounded off , which make them obedient and mediocre.

From what has been discussed above, we can safely draw a conclusion that parents should abandon the use of strict rules to educate their kids. On one hand, the strict rules puts a limit on children's creativity and imagination . On the other hand, they wear down the children's bravery to express different ideas and fight for their own interests.
