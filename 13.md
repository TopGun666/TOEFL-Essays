There is no denying  that education has become one of the most important expenditures for a family. Not only do some parents try to provide their kids with premium educational resources, but also they involve themselves in kids' doing their schoolwork. The practices reflect the so-called "poor parental love," which is also a widely observed phenomenon. However, I choose to stand on the opposite side of it. My reasons and example are given below.

First of all, doing schoolwork independently deepens students' understanding of that they have learnt in school. Given that knowledge can only be absorbed through repetition, schoolwork provides a perfect opportunity for students to review and repeat things they have learnt. If someone else gets involved in the process, students will fail to complete the absorption and digestion of the knowledge. Imagine that a father, who is good at math, often helps his daughter with her math homework. Even though the girl's homework is perfectly finished, her math teacher will not be able to measure how much knowledge she has grasped.

Also, encouraging students to do schoolwork all by themselves contributes to their overall development. Without the help of others, students have no choice but to deal with tasks assigned by teachers on their own. In the process, they will gradually learn to think independently, search for materials in library and turn to someone else for help when encountering unexpected problem. My cousin serves as a counter example. He frequently asked his parents to do the homework for him, leading him to become lazy and dependent. Consequently, being short of necessary academic abilities, he failed in the exams many times and may not graduate.

Admittedly, I am not saying that parents should pay no attention to their kids' homework. In a sense, parental participation does have some advantages. For instance, since some kids lack self-discipline, parent's supervision can effectively prevent those kids from being easily distracted by something else. However, parents are highly advised not to interfere with the process of kids' doing their homework. Otherwise, kids would be deprived of the opportunity to grow up academically. 

In brief, it is out of question that parents should encourage their kids to do the schoolwork independently. From the past to present, study has always been an individual's own  business. As an integral part of your study, schoolwork should never be done by someone else for you.
