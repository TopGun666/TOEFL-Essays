Thanks to the progress of technology, modern people are capable of knowing about almost everything happening around the world quickly and timely. Some people claim that it is pointless to learn about the events without direct connection to us, while others believe we would better grasp all kinds of information regardless of whether it affects our lives or not. As for me, I prefer the latter perspective, and I am going to discuss about it by the following two cases.

For students, knowing about global news is beneficial for their  overall development. Even though some news does not have anything to do with their lives, the process of gaining them can be a real eye-opening experience, which broadens students' horizon and deepens their understanding of the world. My cousin is a good case in point. Her installed a satellite TV at home so as to encourage her to know more about the world. Having watched abundant global news on BBC or CNN, my cousin has expanded  her scope of knowledge. I am often amazed by her opinions on global issues, which are more insightful than that of her peers.

For adults, grasping worldwide events allow them to make better decisions. It is because a seemingly irrelevant event is likely to have an impact on our lives in a roundabout way. For example, my uncle is a businessman who owns a gas station. In 2003, when he learnt that the US might use force agianst lraq, he predicted that the price of oil would soar in a short period of time. Thus, he timely purchased a great deal of oil at a low price, which help ed him make a good fortune after the breakout of the war.

Admittedly, I am not saying that we should be mindful of everything that is happening in the world, given the limitation of our time and attention. Spending time on a sea of information would distract us from doing what we should do. However, the value of information cannot be overestimated. Therefore, we can take advantage o leisure time to browse news. Also, we need to learn how to select the news that is meaningful to us.

To sum up, it is essential for everyone to know about worldwide happenings even though they do not affect our lives. No matter kids or adults, those who are sensitive to what is happening around the world will occupy a vantage point in competition.
