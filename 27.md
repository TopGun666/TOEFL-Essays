Tourism has become a mainstay of economy in many countries. If a country wants t attract more visitors, it should possess not only a secure environment but also a couple of amazing tourist spots. Then, which factor above weighs more? Opinions differ from one person to another. As far as I'm concerned. more efforts should be made to improve its tourist attractions, like repairing old buildings and streets. My reasons and examples are given below.

To begin with, tourists visit a country for its wonderful attractions, not for security. Nobody will be stupid enough to spend a big sum of money on the flight and hotel to just enjoy the safety of a place. If that's the case, they do not have to go anywhere because home is the safest of a place in the world. As a matter of fact, some tourism enthusiasts even take risks to visit dangerous places in order to appreciate the breathtaking views there. For example, I have a friend who is tired of regular tourist destinations. And last year, he went to lraq alone to visit some places of historic interest, paying no attention to local unsafe factors.

In addition, a high-quality tourist attraction can speak for itself, which brings more visitors. It is true that a famous tourist attraction is the main reason why tourists come, but if it is out of repair for long years, the charm of the spot will gradually fade away. Obviously, it is government's compelling obligation to repair those tourist attractions and restore the beauty and splendor in the past. Taking Forbidden City in Beijing for example, the government is making an unceasing effort to repair all the buildings and streets inside. This conduct makes Forbidden City a world-class tourist spot, attracting a large number of visitors each year.

Last but not least, hiring too many policemen is a double-blade sword. On one hand a strong police power serve as an effective deterrence against crimes. On the other hand, too much police patrol in scenic regions will create an air of tension. Visitors will get a feeling that something is wrong with the place and this feeling will really make them uneasy and dampen their spirits. This is definitely not what the government wants to see.

In summary, between hiring police and repairing old buildings and streets, the latter is an wiser conduct. It is not only because the tourist spot is visitors' No.1 consideration but also because a more appealing tourist spot will absolutely lead to the surge of tourists.
