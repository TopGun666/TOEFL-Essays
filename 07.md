As is known. young people have been a driving force to social process. They are dedicating their vigor and aspiration to make the world a better place. But some people claim that in this money-oriented society, young people become less likely to invest their time and efforts in improving the world. In my opinion, it is just the other way around, and modern young people show more passion about changing the world.

First, the Internet furnishes young people with information to improve the world, which help open their minds. In the past, without Internet, young people were hardly exposed to what was happening around the world. Thanks to the development of Internet, young people are given a possibility to understand what the world needs and what they can do for it. For example, an activity called " ALS ice bucket challenge" drew a worldwide attention. Numerous youngsters shared their pictures of doing the ice bucket challenge on social media, which aroused more public awareness of the disease called ALS.

Secondly, the transformation of teaching methods allows young people to think more about what they can do for the world. Teachers no longer ask their students to only focus on academic performance, but try to encourage them to think more and do more for the society.

Thus, those young people are inspired to think of good ideas and carry out them to change the community. Taking my brother for example, as a beneficiary of school's education of environmental protection, he started an activity last year to cleanse the environment by picking up cigarette ends on streets. This practice soon gained supports from his classmates as well as students from higher grades.

Admittedly, I am not denying what young people in the past did to change the society. Since it has always been human's pursuit to build a better world, good people and good deeds were not uncommon in the past. However, decades age, teenagers were demanded to strive for better grades at school, leaving them no changes to come up with ideas and practice them to improve the world. Plus, due to the limited ways of communication, it was hard for some activities to organized.

From what has been discussed above, we can draw a conclusion that young people  today are more willing and capable to invest their time and efforts in improving the world. The more society develops, the lagers number of young people will be awakened ti devote to making the world a better place.
