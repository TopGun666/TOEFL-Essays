At present, in the wake of intense competition in workplace, people are exposed to a great deal of pressure.                  In order to relax, they tend to take approaches such as watching movies, reading books or doing physical exercises when stressing out. However, from my point of view,  physical exercises are exactly what a stressful person needs. My viewpoint is based on the following reasons and examples. 

The first benefit that doing physical exercise can bring is that during the exercises, people's mind is set at ease. Mental relaxation is something that modern people particularly require in such a competitive world. Physical exercises unwind us by shifting our concentration from work to breathing or muscle building. Nevertheless, watching movies and reading books, in most cases, yield a counterproductive result, for our minds are still running especially in the middle of nerve-racking thrillers or fictions. Taking myself for example, my tiredness as a result of a full day's work will be gone after finishing 1 kilometer's jogging on the treadmill with out thinking about work.

in addition, physical exercises are conducive to people's physical condition, which  intensifies their resistance again fatigue. Although a person may feel exhausted physically after doing some sports, his or her cardiovascular system is enhances during the exercises, and the blood circulation would become more efficient. In contrast, watching movies and reading  books inactive, thus causing serious physical problems. For example, my uncle is a software engineer. His job nothing but writing codes in front of computers all year round. Instead of doing any sports, he tends to watch movies and eat snacks to relax. As a result, obesity and high blood pressure have come along.

Admittedly, I do not mean that watching movies and reading books play no role in helping people relax. After all, our bodies are at rest while watching movies or reading books. However, compared to doing exercises, sitting there watching or reading is to a large extent detrimental to our physical health because the state of inactivity would weaken our ability to get rid of stress. In addition, the excessive use of eyes could undoubtedly bring harms to our sights.

To put it in a nutshell, doing exercises is more advantageous than watching movies or reading books in helping people relax. It is because exercises not only not only provide a perfect opportunity to relax our minds, but also enable people to stand up to pressure of work.
