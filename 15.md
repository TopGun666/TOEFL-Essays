In one's life, there are countless problem to face . Then people have always been in pursuit of proper  strategies to solve those problems, and their opinions, and divided. Some people deem creativity as the only source of solutions  to a problem while others prefer to plan carefully before taking any action. As far as I am concerned, planning carefully is a more effective problem-solving skill than being creative. Here are my reasons and examples.

To begin with, a thoughtful planning can help us find the real cause of a problem. A problem, with a complicated cause, is not always what it looks like. If we fail to get a grip of its cause, we stand no chance to tackle it successfully, no matter how creative we are. A detailed planning is likely to lead us to the cause. For a doctor, when facing a patient with a symptom of flu, he will not simply prescribe some cold medicines but have the patient undergo a series of check-ups such as blood test or even X ray. The check-ups are somewhat a careful plan before making a right decision.

In addition, productivity and efficiency will be greatly improved by careful planning. If we miss this step, any creative idea coming from brainstorming are nothing but efforts in vain. I, myself, serve as a good example. Every time at the end of the semester, I am  always as busy as a beaver, because I have to prepare for final exams, write papers of different subjects, and work on  some research reports. Without planning, I will easily get lost in such a busy schedule. Thus, I make a "to do" list according to priorities of tasks and mark the finished items as I move forward. In this way, I can manage my time well and solve multiple problems at the same time.

Admittedly, I am denying the value of coming up with creative ideas to solve a problems. For instance, as an old saying goes, " Man proposes, God disposes." Under some circumstances, things do not go as we expected. A creative person can always have a quick respond to an emergency. However, it is OK for being creative to be the last resort in extreme cases ,but it should never displace planning carefully as the main approach towards problems. 

In the end, I would like to sum up this composition by quoting an ancient Chinese proverb:" Preparedness ensures success and unpreparedness spells failure." The proverb means a good plan always leads to the successful settlement of a problem.
