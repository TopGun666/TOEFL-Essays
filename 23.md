I have done my best.

Life is an experience of setting goals and achieving them. Some people work hard to pursue ambitious goals while others devote to realistic ones. Then, which goal setting makes more sense for modern people? This question has aroused a heated debate in society recently. As far as I am concerned, we should set our goals as high as possible in order to achieve the best result. I am going to elaborate this viewpoint in the following paragraphs.

For individuals,  the higher the goal is, the better the result will be. It is because there is always a gap between reality and dream. Higher goals can galvanize people to push to the limit and achieve more. Instead, aiming at realistic goals, people are more likely to produce results less than they expect. For example, when I was in high school, my father usually encouraged me to set the goal of a test score beyond my ability, so that I would force myself to work harder every time to get closer to that goal. Thanks to my father's strategy, my test score was always far above my expectation.

For all mankind, ambitious goals allow human beings to boldly go where no one has gone before. Without audacious dreams, the world would not have been what it is today. It is those "unrealistic" dreams that drive human beings to break new ground and make new breakthroughs all the time. Jack Ma, probably the most famous Chinese businessman, once proposed that he wanted to build an e-commerce platform for all merchants to do business, but that time he was just considered nothing but a guy talking idiotic nonsense. If Jack Ma had not set such a goal, there would not have been Alibaba Group, a great enterprise changing the lives of millions.

Admittedly, I am not denying the advantages of realistic goals. Compared to ambitious ones, realistic goals are more attainable and less stressful. However, the obsession with realistic goals will make people short-sighted, reducing their possibility to think out of the box and get what is out of their reach. In this sense, people with ambitious goals are inclined to make a significant success.

In summary, it is more meaningful for people to follow ambitious goals rather than realistic ones. I am a big fan of a movieï¼Œ Turbo, in which a line has left me a deep impression: No dream is too big, and no dreamer is too small. Thus, let's never be stingy about our dreams. Make them big and make them happen.
