It is widely observed that students in high schools are required to study many different subjects at the same time. With this phenomenon comes an opposite opinion that this way of education is obviously putting excessive pressure on students, so requiring students to study only three or four subjects at a time may be more reasonable. In my opinion, a student will benefit more from learning as many subjects as they can in high school. My reasons an examples are given below.

First and foremost, high school period is the prime time for one to learn as much as possible. In high school, a student usually has nothing else to worry about except study, which means if he /she doesn't seize the chance to take more subjects, he/she is unlikely to make up later. Taking me for example, when I was in high school, I didn't choose the course of graphic design due to my laziness. Later in university, I always wanted to make up this course, only to find a heavy workload left me no extra time, such as my major courses, social activities and job interviews.

In addition, the learning of many different subjects is conducive to a student's overall development. Modern careers require people to possess a large scope of knowledge. In other words, a person with an interdisciplinary background stands a fair chance to be more successful. Under such circumstances, high schools should help students lay a foundation for the future by requiring students to study as more as possible. For example, math and science make one precise and rational; liberal arts make one emotional and sympathetic. The combination of both can undoubtedly increase one's chances of being successful. 

Admittedly, it might sound plausible that learning many different subjects at the same time is like biting off more than they can chew. Certainly, if students are allowed to study only a couple of subjects, they will feel less stressful. However, nobody can succeed casually. It is true studying many subjects does cost students a lot of energy and time, but they will find out that every effort they've made will be rewarded in the future.

In summary, a high school should take the responsibility to demand its students to study as many different subjects as they can. To quote Steve Jobs, "You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect they looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future." Subjects you studied in high school are just the dots, and they will magically connect with each other and give you a big surprise in the future.
