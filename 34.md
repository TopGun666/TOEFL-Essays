As a saying goes, life lies in doing sports. What does that mean? Some people interpret it as that sports can not only give  us healthy lifestyles, but also make us know many important truths  about life. As far as  I am concerned, this interpretation is absolutely correct, and I especially agree that doing sports is indeed a learning experience. I am going to elaborate my viewpoint by analyzing several typical sports  as follows.

First of all, in playing football, people can learn how to cooperate. Cooperation, rather than going it  alone,  is one of important rules of survival in modern society. Those who often play football particularly understand the importance of cooperation. The whole football team needs to fully cooperate with each other, like a sophisticated instrument. The better they can cooperate with each other, the more likely they are to win a game: midfielders are responsible for organizing with each other, the more likely they are to win a game: midfielders are responsible for organizing an attack; strikers attack and score goals; defenders prevent opponents from getting into the box; and the goalkeeper tries to keep the clean sheet.

What is more, marathon teaches people persistence. Nowadays, modern people are usually restless without willpower that is needed to help them achieve the goal. Since a young age, we have been told that persistence. Nowadays, modern people are usually restless without willpower that is needed to help them achieve the goal. Since a young age, we have been told that persistence can lead to success, and this old philosophy completely embodies itself in marathon. The success is never determined only by speed, but by both speed and endurance. In a full marathon, about 26 miles, a participant will encounter many difficulties: thirsty, fatigue, discomfort, boredom, but he need to focus on the goal with great persistence and willpower.

Other sports like climbing or diving can also make us understand something about life. Just like a beautiful rainbow always shows up after a terrible storm, one couldn't see the breathtaking views without bearing the pain in the process of climbing or diving. A climber needs to move up little against the pull of gravity, and a diver needs to overcome water pressure, Although they engage in  different sports , they have one thing in common: to take the most beautiful view as the reward for what they have endured.

In summary, sports really teach us many meaningful lessons which are not available in school. Sports are the best gifts given by God, which makes human beings strong both physically and mentally.
