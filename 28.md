Space us such an unfathomable existence that drives generations of human beings to tap into its secret. Many substantial countries consider space exploration as one of its most important national-level strategic programs. Thus, an interesting discussion arises among the public about whether this kind of investment is worth it. As far as I am concerned, space exploration is absolutely not a waste of money, and has its incomparable values. My viewpoint is based on the following reasons.

Firstly, a great many essential and widespread technologies are fruits of space exploration. Space exploration gives human beings a whole new perspective to look at our planet. High above the earth, we are able to observe the changing of clouds as well as formations of the Earth's surface. which not only betters our understanding of the Earth but also provides great convenience to our life. The invention of GPS is a good case in point. Based on the information coming from satellites, GPS can tell people the exact location of any place they want to go, and figure out the shortest route to reach there.

Secondly, a country can showcase its comprehensive national power by exploring space, enhancing its international presence. Space exploration is a reflection of a country's strength in economy and science and science and technology. A country with cutting-edge technology and abundant capital will have a greater say in international affairs. For example, during cold war, two superpowers, Soviet Union and the US, competed against each other in trying to get the control of the universe. When Soviet Union announced its successful launching of manned space aircraft, the US was reluctant to show weakness and unprecedentedly sent astronauts onto the Moon, which greatly enhanced the international influence of the US.

Admittedly, space exploration seemingly has little to do with ordinary people's livelihood, and it really accounts for quite a share in a country's fiscal budget, That explains why some would express opposing opinions towards the practice. However, it is just a shortsighted view that space exploration is worthless. Looking into the future, we have reasons to believe that if space technology is monopolized by a few countries, a country without the technology will lose the upper hand in international competition.

To recap, space exploration is of far-reaching implication to a country. It is not only because the rank and file can be direct beneficiary of space exploration, but also because the practice to explore the space endows a country with many additional values.
