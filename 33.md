As urbanization is gaining momentum, there has been an influx of people from rural areas into big cities. Thus , this phenomenon has triggered a question:  are big really attractive? Some people prefer to live in metropolis while others are yearning for the lifestyle in small places. In my opinion, to live in big cities is a better choice for modern people. I am going to elaborate my viewpoint in the following paragraphs.

To begin with, the means of transportation in the big city is very convenient. It is because city dwellers have various options when they meed to move from one place to another, such as taking buses, subways or taxis. On the contrary, there are not many choices available for villagers. My cousin is a good case in point, who used t olive in a village. She told me that it usually took her about one hour to go to school before. By contrast, in the city, she only has to spend 10 minutes finishing the same distance by subway.

In addition, city dwellers can have more access to opportunities of decent jobs. As we know, there are a number of famous companies, factories, and shopping malls in big cities. In contrast,  in small villages, there is less prosperous commercial environment, which means that the odds of getting a good job are slim. Taking my elder brother for example, having  graduated from a prestigious university in China a couple of years ago, he chose to go back to hometown- a small village, in stead of staying in a big city. Due to the lack of working opportunities, he is currently working as a technician in a local factory, totally  wasting his  admirable academic background.

Admittedly, I am not denying the benefits of living in small villages. For instance, one can enjoy a more pleasant and healthier environment out there: the water is clean, the sky is blue and the air people breathe has not yet been polluted. However, it is pointless to live in a good environment without having the chance to realize the value of life. It is big cities, rather than small villages, that can provide us with a big stage to make our dreams come true.

To put it into nutshell, people should grasp any chance to stay and develop in big cities. It is not only because the traffic condition is more convenient, but also because city dwellers can have a smoother and more successful career path.
