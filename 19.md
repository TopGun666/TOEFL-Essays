Cooking  and preparing foods are supposed to be basic skill for human beings, but we fail to see that this skill is well passed on to modern young people. Fierce  competition and survival pressure leave them no time to enjoy a meal made by their own hands. Thus, some sociologists predict that people will spend less time cooking and preparing foods in twenty years. As for me, I have to admit they are right about the trend. My reasons and example are as follows.

Firstly, mounting  pressure makes it an unrealistic dream for modern people to cook at home. Students face endless assignment, and their pushy parents certainly do not want them to squander some time in kitchen. Young office workers, for better pay or promotion, usually work overtime. 20 years from now, when those young adults become busier and face more pressure, they will naturally tend to avoid cooking by themselves. Taking myself for example, I do not cook because it is truly time-consuming. If I go to market and prepare everything for a diner, there will be little time for me to deal with my study.

Secondly, eating is actually getting amazingly convenient thanks to the progress of the Internet. With the division of labor in society, the idea that professional people do professional things is becoming a reality. With a click of a button, delicious food will be delivered to the door of our home. People never put up with the smell of cooking and get their hands dirty in sink. The lunch I had yesterday was ordered from an online fast food store, an it was wonderful combination including seafood, vegetable and rice. What's  more, the price was reasonable and I did not have to wait for long.

Of course, I have to admit that cooking can be a favorable hobby to some of us, and I can vicariously feel the sense of achievement when others praise us for the wonderful meal made by our own hands. However, it would be hard to make a hobby a daily routine. With the increasingly fierce competition, young people are bound to spend less time on food preparation.

In conclusion, the trend that people eat out or order food online will continue. By and large, it is not a bad thing that people gradually lose the ability to cook well, because this trend is a reflection of a more an more professional society.
