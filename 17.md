Help others has always been a virtue. It is a common belief that young people should offer a helping hand to those in difficulties. However, with rapid development of economy, people begin to be increasingly concerned about material success, creating a selfish young generation. As far as I am concerned, today's young people are less altruistic than those in past. I am going to further elaborate my point of view in the following paragraphs.

Firstly, today's children are spoiled. As modern people are getting richer, they always do much as they can to provide their kids with the best condition and satisfy their kids' demand. Too much of parents' love and care has gradually given their kids a sense of superiority, and deprived them of the the ability to respect and help others. I often observe in a bus that young people sit in the seats reserved for senior citizens. Even though an elder is standing beside, some youngsters still pretend to be absorbed in video games, forgetting the social responsibility to offer chair to those in need.

Secondly, the pressure confronted by people is chokingly high, leaving them almost no time to help others. As is known to all, students have to work very hard to get admitted into good universities. After graduation, what awaits them feel less encouraged to help others. Imagine that a young man hurries to go to work, for there is an emergency waiting him to deal with. Under such circumstances, he cannot afford the time to help people around like bringing a lost child to the police.

Admittedly, I am not saying that all the young people keep themselves away from helping others, In fact, it is not  uncommon to find many school volunteer programs that aim to help those in need. However, quite a few charitable and volunteer activities engaged by young people are built on practical purpose. Some people do them just for gaining extra credits, while others want to make their resume appear more attractive by adding those experiences.

To put it in a nutshell, today's young people are less willing to help others than previous generations, because they are born an raised in a different period of time. As a matter of fact, government and society should ponder over the negative impacts brought by economic prosperity upon generation.
