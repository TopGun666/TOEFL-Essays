Student organization is no longer a fresh word to students, which opens the door to a colorful campus life. When it comes to electing a leader for a student organizing, there are usually many factors to be taken into account. Some people claim that honesty is the most important one. But in my opinion, that is a biased assertion because some qualities weigh more than honesty. I am going to highlight two qualities in the following paragraphs.

Firstly, the candidate's coordination ability is of vital importance. In order to accomplish the goal of student organization, the leader should be good at taking advantage of all kinds of resources including manpower, materials and funds. For example, my cousin is in charge of a popular photography club in his university. His excellent coordination ability helps the club grow stronger. He once led his team to hold an on-campus photography exhibition, which was very well received. Not only did he manage to mobilize all members to pitch in, bey also he raised enough sponsorship fees from some enterprises.

Secondly, leading by example is another necessary quality for a leader. In arguably, students are nowadays confronted with a lot of pressure from study and other personal issues to take care of. It is indeed difficult for them to sacrifice their personal interests for engagement in tasks of student organizations. If a leader lacks the spirit of sacrifice and cares about himself more than the organizing, no one is willing to do his or her part. In contrast, if a leader burns the midnight oil to design activity plans, and works harder than anyone else, rather than bosses around in activity site, his team member's passion must be ignited.

Admittedly, I am not denying the importance of being honest. It is true that an honest leader, who always gives people a sense of security, stands a fair chance to be trusted be his team members. However, as a personal virtue, honesty cannot work as driving force to the development of an organization. In this sense, it is arbitrary and unilateral to conclude that honesty is the most important factor to be considered in electing a leader for student organization.

In conclusion, when I am helping to elect the future students leader from candidates. I do not agree that honesty should come first. In order to lead the team to a greater achievement, a leader should possess more important qualities, such as coordination ability and spirit of sacrifice.
