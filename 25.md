Problems and conflicts not only occur between enemies, but also occur between friends, even between long-time friends. Some people say frankly that they find if hard hard to put up with the friend who has done something nasty. As far as I am concerned, I will not discontinue a long-time friendship just because my friends have done something I do not like. I am going to elaborate this viewpoint in the following paragraphs.

Firstly, tolerance is the cornerstone of friendship. A nice friend must be good at bearing people's shortcomings and imperfections, which can bring a sense of security and warmth. If nobody was willing to tolerate his or her friend's mistakes, there would have been no long-lasting friendship in the world. I remember when I was willing to tolerate his or her friend's mistakes, there would have been no long-lasting  friendship in the world. I remember when I was in high school, one of my best friends Tom cheated in the exam. As the monitor of the class, I told the teacher about his misconduct. To my big surprise, he didn't hate me but acknowledged his fault. It is Tom's tolerance that makes a great friendship between us. Next time if he does something I do not like, I will tolerate him as well.

Secondly, a friend might sometimes do something that discomfort us, but with good intentions. They just do it in an unpleasant way. If we can discern the goodwill behind what they do, we are likely to change from being angry to grateful. Thus, it is obviously unwise to discontinue the friendship with a long-time friend just because of misunderstanding. Still taking for example the above-mentioned experience of mine, my conduct of informing the teacher appears somewhat unkind and even harsh to a friend, but my intention was to teach Tom a lesson that cheating is a wrong thing to do.

Admittedly,  I am not saying that we have to be a doormat all the time if our friends do something that make us unhappy. As a matter of fact, a blind tolerance simply makes things worse. However, an open and sincere talk can play a very effective role in dissolving the tension between friends. During the talk, we may find that out friend does it just for the good of us or there is a misunderstanding.

To put it in a nutshell, a long-lasting friendship stands the test of difficulty. Chairman Man, the founder of PRC, one said, "Long live the mutual understanding." If we think less about ourselves and care more about out friends, the world will become a better place to live.
