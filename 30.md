In most cases, schools begin a day's schedule at an early hour in the morning, while students have complaints about such a setting. It is not uncommon to find out that many students get punished because of being late for school. The debate concerning when a school day should start has been around for a long time.  As far as I am concerned, starting a school  day early in the morning is a better approach that is beneficial for students' learning. My reasons and examples are given below.

First and foremost, morning is the prime time for a student to absorb knowledge. It is because after a whole night's rest. one's body is usually at its best in the morning, with the brain awake and active. At this moment, students have good memories and therefore they can study with high efficiency. For example, one of my dorm mates, Jason, is proficient in English, because he gets up earlier than the rest of us, and goes to the classroom to memorize new English words or practice pronunciation every day.

In addition, requiring students to start at an early hour can foster the spirit to overcome difficulties. Students, especially ones at a young age, generally lack the courage to meet challenges, They tend to stay in their comfort zone, with the backlash against anything that discomforts them. Getting up early in the morning may be tough, but it is indeed good for their health and study. If students are allow to go to school at a late hour, they are likely to keep away from other obstacles. Many world-class business leaders, role models to youngsters, arrive at the companies earlier than employees. Just because of this spirit, they lead the company to overcome difficulties one after another and achieve remarkable success .

Admittedly, I am not denying the disadvantage of starting school day at an early time. For instance, some students, who live far away from school, can have a real problem. They have to get up much earlier to beat the traffic, and when they come to the school, they may very well be exhausted. However, it is school's responsibility to do something for those students. For example, schools  can build dormitories to help fix the problem. Anyway, solutions are always more than questions.

To recap, starting school early is a necessary and meaningful arrangement for students. As a proverb goes, " An hour in the morning is worth two in the evening." if students can make good use of morning hours, more productivity will be generated.
